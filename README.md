![image](https://github.com/riyouuyt/Predict-Clicked-Ads-Customer-Classification-by-using-Machine-Learning/assets/122600889/7dc3dacf-6bf3-47a9-b540-5d573d9bcf84)

üìä Columns with Null Values:
* `Daily Time Spent on Site` and `Area Income` each had a 1.3% null rate.
* `Daily Internet Usage` had a 1.1% null rate.
* `Male` exhibited a mere 0.3% of missing values.
* `Unnamed: 0`, `Age`, `Timestamp`, `Clicked on Ad`, `city`, `province`, and `category` were entirely free from null values.

Ensuring data integrity is essential for reliable analysis. We'll handle these missing values appropriately to maintain data quality. üõ†Ô∏è

### üßπ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Summary üßº

Our data underwent a comprehensive cleaning and preprocessing journey, ensuring its readiness for analysis. Here's what we accomplished:

* üöÆ Handling Missing Values: We meticulously addressed missing values, ensuring minimal data loss: `Daily Time Spent on Site`, `Area Income`, `Daily Internet Usage`, and `Male` columns had missing values, which were handled appropriately. `Unnamed: 0`, `Age`, `Timestamp`, `Clicked on Ad`, `city`, `province`, and `category` columns remained free from null values.

* üßΩ Duplicate Data: We identified and successfully removed duplicate rows from the dataset, leaving us with a pristine dataset, completely devoid of duplicates.

* üîÑ Feature Encoding: We encoded categorical columns `Gender` and `Clicked on Ad` using one-hot encoding, making them ready for machine learning models.

* üìõ Column Renaming: We renamed columns for clarity and consistency, including renaming `Gender` columns for better interpretation.

* üî™ Column Removal: We removed the `Unnamed: 0` column, which didn't contribute to our analysis.

Now, with our dataset clean, structured, and encoded, we're primed for in-depth analysis and predictive modeling! üöÄüîç

## Prepare for The Modelling
* üéØ Splitting Data: We divided our dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y). The 'Clicked on Ad_Yes' column serves as our target, while the remaining columns comprise our features.
* 
* üï∞Ô∏è Extracting Date Information: To unlock valuable insights, we extracted date-related details from the `Timestamp` column:
  * We converted the `Timestamp` column to datetime format to ensure accurate time-related calculations.
  * We created new columns, including `Year`, `Month`, `Week`, and `Day`, to dissect the timestamp data into various time components.

These meticulous preparations set the stage for our exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling, empowering us to uncover meaningful patterns and make informed decisions! üöÄüìà

##Modelling
We conduct two experiments, one before normalization/standardization and another after applying these techniques, to understand how they influence our model's performance. This comparison allows us to make informed decisions about whether to include these data preprocessing steps in our predictive modeling pipeline.

In the first experiment, we work with raw, unnormalized data to assess the initial performance of the model. We then contrast this with the second experiment, where we apply normalization/standardization techniques to the data. By doing so, we aim to observe any notable improvements in model accuracy and performance and identify which features play a more significant role under different data transformation scenarios.

This comparative analysis will guide us in determining the most effective approach for handling our data, ensuring we build a predictive model that can reliably classify ad clicks with precision.
